       "array([\"Ok - newsflash.  Diapers are just smelly.  We\\\\'ve had this pail for 2.5 years now.  It was our first and primary one.  There were no major smell problems until after one year, when our son started eating solids.  Also, we change the bag twice weekly as 3 days is about the max for smell-containment.  Around 20-22 months we started shopping for a container that would be less smelly and didn\\\\'t find one as good.  (We have a cheaper one upstairs which broke immediately and always stunk!)  We finally just put the Diaper Champ in the attic a few months ago and use the cheap one with the flip-up lid - mainly since the cheapo fits inside the cabinet and we didn\\\\'t notice a big difference in smell-control.  (The most helpful action is to tie the dirty diapers inside a small plastic bag before putting them in the pail.)A couple of our friends have this pail and were pleased until the children started eating solid food and things got stinkier - but that\\\\'s pretty much the consensus according to many reviews on the different pails.  I\\\\'ve knocked off a star since the mechanism isn\\\\'t that intuitive (to grandmothers and babysitters, at least) and it frequently gets stuck when the bag starts getting full.  Plus there are some smell issues, as with any pail.  However, the fact that you can use regular trash bags is so much more convenient!\",\n",
       "       'My husband and I selected the Diaper \"Champ\" mainly because you can use ordinary trash bags and not be roped into buying the specialty refill bags, and it was moderately priced (a little less than the Diaper Dekor). It also seemed that the reviews of this product were generally more positive...The positives are:1. You can use any trash bag2. Easy to use and refillThe negatives are:1. The bag doesn\\\\\\'t seal around the dirty diapers, so when it comes time to refill the bag, it\\\\\\'s just like opening a regular trash can. Smells like the Champ is trying to knock YOU out with odor!2. The plastic seems to smell, ie. You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ. That \"side\" of the plastic dumper-thingie is in contact with the air inside the dirty diaper changer, so when you flip it over the next time to dispose of another diaper, you smell the last 8 diapers you put in there...pretty gross.3. The \"odor seal\" (some soft material) really seems to retain odor. It cannot be washed or replaced, so after a while, the Diaper \"Champ\" smells even when freshly washed and deodorized (I\\\\\\'m talking about hosing down outside and scrubbing with Clorox cleanser!). Super-frustrating! This is my primary complaint.Okay, so some things are a given as far as disposal systems go (ie. *some* odor, must empty frequently, must wash and disinfect occasionally), but still I think this product leaves much to be desired.We\\\\\\'re going to try another disposal system.',\n",
       "       'Excellent diaper disposal unit.  I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).  I am soooo pleased with this product!!! A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!',\n",
       "       \"We love our diaper champ.  It is very easy to use just drop the diaper in and flip the top over.  No need to stick your hand inside.  No hint of an odor, even when you are putting another dipaer in.  When it gets full, just put in a new trash bags.  The best feature of all is that even the most curious little ones can\\\\'t get into the diapers.  Before we found the diaper champ, we had another diaper pail and our son learned to open it and pull the diapers out.  That is no longer a problem!!\",\n",
       "       \"Two girlfriends and two family members put me onto this diaper pail.  They each had tried the Diaper Genie and had horrible results with eventual smells, and costliness of buying proprietary DG cartridges.  My family members eventually started bringing every dirty diaper out to the trash and leaving just wet diapers in the DG, that is until they found out about the Diaper Champ!Wow, what a difference, it seals in orders very well and using normal 8 - 13 gallon trash bags makes it economical.  The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child\\\\'s point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.  Also, it needs to be away from the wall a little bit, so that it\\\\'s flip top access lid locks into place and doesn\\\\'t plop back down, but when engaged, the top will stay open so you can get at the bag of diapers within without having it fall onto your hand.We keep a little can of Oust nearby, spritz it before opening the top, grab the bag at it\\\\'s neck to close off stinky odors, lift it out, twist it at the top and secure it with a twist-tie, and away we go to the garbage can.  And we take antibacterial wipes and run them around in the plunger area on both sides, voila, it\\\\'s clean.At 3 months, we change the bag about 1 - 2 times a week.  Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that\\\\'s better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.\",\n",
       "       'I waited to review this until I saw how it performed in the really-stinky-diaper stage.  Now, with my daughter at 1 year and eating lots of solids (and making really stinky diapers), I can happily recommend the diaper champ.  A couple suggestions: 1) as baby\\\\\\'s poop gets stinkier, empty more often (at least once a week) and 2) every time you empty, spray with Lysol or similar product and wipe out with antibacterial cleaner.  This second step has kept the plastic from retaining a bad smell.I gave 4 stars because it\\\\\\'s not \"perfect\" -- sometimes a little smell leaks out if it\\\\\\'s very full.  But all around a good product, and not needing special refill bags is a huge benefit for a busy mom.',\n",
       "       'I have had a diaper genie for almost 4 years since my first son was born and I have been using it with my second as well.  I thought I\\\\\\'d try the champ to save $ on the genie refills.  Well it is not a $ saver because it does not hold the odor inside so I was constantly changing the trash bags.  The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.  The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.  I suppose you could use it as a regular trash can in your child\\\\\\'s room-they wouldn\\\\\\'t be able to get into it!  Don\\\\\\'t waste your $ to \"save\" $!  Buy the genie-your nose will thank you!!  Also, if you don\\\\\\'t keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it! YUCK!',\n",
       "       \"I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.  I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn\\\\'t like the idea of having to buy special bags.  Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed \\\\'diaper odor.\\\\'  In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son\\\\'s diaper have been amazed at how the very \\\\'potent\\\\' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!  I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.  For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!  Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.  SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn\\\\'t as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.  Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.\",\n",
       "       \"I am so glad I got the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie!  You can use pretty much any plastic bag - even a grocery bag will do in a pinch.  My baby is 6 weeks and I have never smelled any odors at all from the Champ.  I especially like the way you close it - you just flip the handle and that\\\\'s it.  The Champ is definitely the best.\",\n",
       "       \"We had 2 diaper Genie\\\\'s both given to us as a gift but it was hard to use it since everytime you stuff the diaper in you have to turn it which cannot be done with one hand (required if you are holding your baby).  Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.  On top of that the refills are very expensive.  So we decided to buy Diaper Champ and so far we love it.  It is very easy to use with one hand.  I like the feature that you can acutally clean the chute if for some reason it gets messy.  Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.  It is very easy to use and does not smell unless the bag needs to be replaced and the most important part is that you can use your regular garbage bags (no need for expensive refills).\",\n",
       "       \"When shopping around for a diaper pail I was drawn to the Diaper Champ for several reasons. 1) I loved the idea of using regular plastic bags from the grocery store. 2) The one-hand chute is quick and easy to use while dealing with a squirming baby. 3) I\\\\'d heard negative reviews about the Diaper Genie. Now that I\\\\'ve had the Diaper Champ for 8 months, I\\\\'m looking for a diaper pail that lives up to its name.About 2 months ago the chute began to stick and the pail began to release unpleasant fumes each time I\\\\'d drop a diaper in. The inner lining had come loose and was preventing diapers from dropping down into the bag. Eventually, the lining just fell out and that\\\\'s when the smell became unbearable. Not only is my daughter\\\\'s nursery filled with odors strong enough to give you a headache, the smell is seeping into the hall and down the stairs.Our Diaper Champ is on its way to the recycle bin. It won\\\\'t be returning for a come-back fight.\",\n",
       "       \"This is the very best. So much better than Diaper Genie. No doubt about it. I would never buy Diaper Genie again. As a matter of fact I threw them out. Here you have No Refills to buy, much easier to empty and put in a new garbage bag, a lot cheaper and most of all a lot quieter. The Diaper Genie is so loud when putting in a diaper in the middle of the night that is a pain. I highly recommend this product. In regards to smell?.....excuse me there are diapers in there, not roses. Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go. If you\\\\'re still picky put in an airfreshner.\",\n",
       "       \"We bought this pail because it used regular trash bags and hoped it lived up to all it says - IT DOES!!  We use the scented trash bags and have had no trouble at all!  (It does get a little smelly when you change the bag, but that is expected)The only thing we don\\\\'t like is the inside lid that holds the bag down. It does not stay up on its own.  So when you change bags it has to be held open with 1 hand-leaving only 1 hand to get the bag out.  It just makes it akward.My husband even recommends it!!  So it has to be good.\",\n",
       "       \"Diaper Champ or Diaper Genie? That was my dilemma when registering for gifts before my son was born. Lucky for me, I had my Mom with me. She runs a daycare and said Diaper Champ is the best by far and that\\\\'s what I went with. The fact that you can use regular trash bags instead of special cartridges was very appealing to me. Now my son is 6 months old and I must say this thing is GREAT! The only time I catch any smell at all is when I change trash bags. I use those Glad trash bags that are scented to prevent odors and that makes a difference, too. it is very easy and covenient to use and I highly recommend it. The only thing you need to watch is the opening latch is a bit tricky (I broke a nail the first time I used it, but then I got the hang of it). I am glad for this, though, because if it\\\\'s not easy for me to open, it won\\\\'t be for my son, either.\",\n",
       "       'I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!) and it even takes the same bags as my kitchen trash can, shich is super convenient, and cost efficient as I can buy them in bulk.The only reason for not rating it a 5 star was that I did have one small problem with it. The foam gasket in the barrell which keeps the poopy smell inside the unit ripped somehow, and it got VERY stinky. HOWEVER, I contacted the manufacturer though their website, and received an email back the same day stating that this was unusual, and that replacement gaskets were on their way to me. They arrived inside of a week and after replacing, it works great again! (They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!',\n",
       "       \"Although I had a Diaper Genie from my first child, which I hated, I registered for this for my second.  I received very few items from my registry but this was by far the best gift I received overall. It is very easy to operate.  My 4 year old feels a part of the diaper changes because he can work it.  It keeps the smell out which makes mom and dad happy.  But, by far the best thing about the Diaper Champ is that it takes regular trash bags so you don\\\\'t have to worry if [the store] will have the refills.  It is definately a people pleaser!\",\n",
       "       \"Granted our 3-month old isn\\\\'t producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.  My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.\",\n",
       "       'We loved this pail at first. The mechanism seemed ingenius, and we appreciated that it took regular bags. But once our daughter started to stand up, that big white handle was irresistable to her, and before we even realized it, she started flipping it. That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you\\\\\\'ll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers. Worse yet, they can slam a finger then hurt it seriously in their attempts to get it free by pushing the handle the wrong way. It\\\\\\'s really pretty scary.You\\\\\\'ll notice that the positive reviews here generally say \"I\\\\\\'ve been using this for two months, and it\\\\\\'s great!\" But once you have older babies, I\\\\\\'d retire it pronto.',\n",

At home we use the First years product, which isn\\\\'t bad but not as good as this one.There are a couple of occasions that dirty diapers were left in it for a week but i didn\\\\'t know because it didn\\\\'t smell till I opened it to change the garbage bag.I think this is the only diaper pail that is cheap to use yet does the job well.Highly recommend.\",\n",
       "       'I recently gave birth to my third child.  When I had my 1st 11 years ago, I got a Diaper Genie and it worked okay, but the stupid refills for it were so expensive that I soon gave up on it.  Not to mention that the \"sausage links\" of diapers it created were pretty gross and I still had to use a garbage bag to dispose of them.  With this baby, I decided to give the Diaper Champ a try.  I LOVE IT!  In fact, I am considering buying one for my church\\\\\\'s nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.  I agree with any reviews that suggest using scented garbage bags, as it DOES smell pretty awful when you empty it, and I think the scented bags would help that a little.  So far I have had only a minor complaint, and that is that it can be a little tricky to open sometimes, but overall it\\\\\\'s still a great product.  I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.',\n",
       "       \"Our daughter is 13 months old and we\\\\'ve been using the Diaper Champ ever since she was born. I highly recommend it because it\\\\'s a great value.  However, there are a few things to be aware of which is why I only gave 4 stars.1. Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC. My husband learned the hard way that the grips get stuck on the seal and the diaper won\\\\'t drop into the bag.  Then you have to pull the diaper out and the grips slowly pull away the seal.  It didn\\\\'t seem to affect the odor control, but it did make it difficult to move the handle/shoot back and forth.  The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2. The unit is top heavy when it\\\\'s empty. I learned this one the hard way.  When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.  Ouch!!3. No, the stink isn\\\\'t completely trapped, but it\\\\'s pretty darn close! The stinkiest part is emptying a full bag.  I found that putting a stick-up inside the lid has made it much more tolerable.\",\n",

I had always hated that the diaper genie had to have special bags, I was just going to get a regular garbage pail & use that.  That is until we heard about the Diaper Champ.I absolutely love it.  It is a complete life saver all around.  No special bags to buy, not a hassle to put together.  Comes almost all the way assembled out of box just attach to base & voila you are ready to start changing diapers.  A little tip to keep the odor down.  I wipe it out with antibacterial wipes a couple of times a wk, & I spray Lysol disinfecting spray.  Once a month I wash it out with a mild dishwashing detergent.  Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.  It is a sure winner.  You\\\\'ll save a lot of money by using this one.\",\n",

It\\\\'s very economical, too.  Using regular kitchen bags and holding more diapers than the competing diaper disposal system makes this quite efficient.A trick that was passed down to me from an experienced mom to control odor (again, yes, it\\\\'s going to smell a little...you put stinky diapers in it!):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.  I don\\\\'t know why the dryer sheet works...but it does!  And if I don\\\\'t change it out regularly (about once every few weeks) then I start to notice the smell.Recommended above all other diaper pails!

My sis-in law had the diaper champ & I couldn\\\\'t believe she even had any dirty diapers around...there was no smell!  We chucked the genie and bought the champ. It was so much easier to use...just roll the diaper into a little ball and drop into the hole on top, flip the handle and bye bye smelly diaper (my 16 month old can do it) And there were no special bags to buy, just the same regular garbage bags we used already in the kitchen. Experienced parents will understand and appreciate that it comes apart for easier cleaning for those times when it may become a mess.  We had a problem with odors after about a year of use so I called BabyTrend to see what they recommended.  They sent me these replacement sponge gaskets (free of charge) and we were once again odor free. Now on my 3rd child and almost 3 years later, I just called them again to get another set of replacement gaskets (again free of charge) they will be here in about a week.  THIS IS A GREAT ITEM and the company stands behind their product (even years later!)\",\n",

The Diaper Champ uses 10 or 13 gallon trash bags (or you can recycle larger store bags to use in the Champ).  The mechanism doesn\\\\'t let odors out and if you have toddlers that get into everything, they can\\\\'t get into the Diaper Champ!

The plastic supermarket bags are a little too small.In regards to odor control, the DC has been successful for 3/4 of the year.  There is a noticeable smell during the summertime, so I\\\\'ve had to change the bags more frequently on hot days or else face the consequence of suffering the aroma of baking poop.My only negative comment about this product is concerning the lid.  For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.  Even though I have short, uncared for nails, I\\\\'ve had a few bent nails from trying to pull open the lid.  Then, the next problem is that the lid doesn\\\\'t open all the way (like a cigarette lighter).  It opens up to about a 75 degree angle.  This makes it inconvenient when you are trying to remove a stuffed bag of diapers.  Also, the underside of the lid has several plastic sharp juttings against which my hands would occasionally get scratched.  And, during the removal of the full bag, this is when you get the full blast of your little one\\\\'s excretions (quite possibly 3-5 days worth of them), so hold your breath!Although there is room for improvement on this design, I haven\\\\'t seen or heard of any other model that can do this job nearly as well for as reasonable a price.\",\n",

Not only did it do a comparable job at keeping odors inside, it was extremely easy to use and did not require me to spend an additional [$$$] each month on refills.  We decided to go ahead and buy a Diaper Champ because our son was only 13 months old and we figured he\\\\'d be in diapers for at least another year so we\\\\'d be saving money after 6 months by not having to buy the refill cartridges.  Then when our twins were born, we were so glad that we had the Champ!  After all, we\\\\'re already buying tons of diapers, who needs to spend another [$$$] a month on those Genie cartridges?!As for ease of use, my 3.5-year-old son loves throwing the dirty diapers away for me because all you have to do is drop it into the chamber and flip the lid.  It is super easy to empty it too.  And I\\\\'ve found that if I use scented garbage bags and give the inside a quick spray with Lysol each time I empty it, the smell when emptying it is not as bad as it is with the Genie.I HIGHLY recommend the Diaper Champ!

Yes, if you don\\\\'t wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).  Yes, poop does smell (not like roses), but my daughter\\\\'s room doesn\\\\'t smell like poop because the Diaper Champ does a great job of containing odor.  You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.

Wipes get caught in the mechanism and you have to shake and bang it while trying to keep wriggling baby on the changing table. Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often. They\\\\'re bigger than diaper genies, yes, but not quite big enough for a baby with a big appetite.This smearing problem, is, in my opinion, probably the source of the smell that others complain of. We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum. What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch. You\\\\'d need to open the latch before starting the change, and close it after, but that seems easier to me than thumping and wiggling a diaper champ in the middle of the change.

I am pregnant again so these smells get to me.  Because of this problem I gave it 4 stars.It gets stuck from an occasional diaper sticky tab sticking to the inside .

I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I\\\\'ve never had a problem with smell (I\\\\'ve been using it for two+ months now).  You just put the diaper in the hole... flip the lid and the counterweight pushes the diaper down into the bag underneath and its ready for the next diaper--then you flip it back.  The flip handle does get stuck sometimes... but only when it\\\\'s TIME TO EMPTY THE PAIL!!!!  Some reviewers seem to think the pail should empty itself, but unfortunately nothing on the market will do that for you.  When you change the bag (which is incredibly easy to do) you can just spray the inside with a little lysol and then periodically wipe it out with a sponge and some bleach.  I\\\\'d do that much even with the more expensive diaper pails and I\\\\'d still have to buy expensive special bags.... You can\\\\'t expect something that contains poop to smell like a rose or to be germ free without a little work on your part, but with the Diaper Champ you can have a smell-free nursery AND save money by using plain ordinary garbage bags (or recycled plastic bags!)\",\n",

       "       \"As a first time mother, I wanted to get the best for my daughter. I shopped around a lot, and asked a lot of questions. While at someone\\\\'s house, I saw the Diaper Champ. It was one that I hadn\\\\'t seen very much in the various stores I shopped in. I was immediately impressed by the ease of it, and the convenience of being able to use ANY bag!!!When I bought it, I didn\\\\'t have a chance to show my husband how to use it -- but no worries!!! It is so simple to figure out how to use! My nephew -- a toddler, knows how to use it (without him being able to open it up!)I\\\\'ve even recommended it to strangers in the baby stores!You\\\\'ll love it!\",\n",

       "       \"We\\\\'ve now had the Diaper Champ for a little over a year! We love it. It\\\\'s better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn\\\\'t smell! I highly recommend it. Drawbacks: it doesn\\\\'t hold that many diapers at a time. We have 2 in dapers and we changes it 3 times a week or so. It needs to be cleaned pretty often or lots of mold and bacteria start to grow (on the parts you can\\\\'t see until you take it apart). Lastly part of the fabric/plastic material has ripped on part of it so it is a bit harder to flip back in forth when you  put new dirty diapers in! Overall, this is a great product!\",\n",
       "       'After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ. It was highly recommended by a new mom with an infant. Big mistake, her baby as well as most of the people reviewing this positively are using it with their INFANTS, so their diapers do not smell like that of a one or two year old toddler!!!!!!!!  The Genie does a much better job of masking the odors, Yes, it is more cumbersome in terms of changing out the plastic....but that I can live with.  The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!',\n",
       "       \"We put a Diaper Genie on the shower list for the first baby. We used it for 2 years and it was OK but we were fed up with it and I took a chance on the Diaper Champ for #2. After 5 months, we couldn\\\\'t be happier with Diaper Champ. Here\\\\'s a short list of the main reasons I\\\\'d recommend this against diaper genie:5. Diaper Champ doesn\\\\'t use expensive refills like the genie. We were going through 2-3 of those $5 refills a month with the genie. On the conservative side, say that was $120 a year in genie refills. With the Diaper Champ, I bought one big box of Glad Kitchen drawstring bags (150 bags) for $15 at the warehouse club. We change the bag 1-2x weekly. The 150 bags will probably last 1 1/2 -2 years, for $15. (The Champ box says you can use plastic grocery bags. Don\\\\'t. They\\\\'re way too small and don\\\\'t hold enough diapers to make it worth the while.)4. The Champ holds a lot more than the genie. Less frequent emptying.3. The genie was a pain to empty and even more work to change refills. Emptying involves tying off the tiny little sausage tube bag, restarting the cut end of the refill. Pain. Changing the refill was just annoying. When the refill runs out, there\\\\'s not enough bag to tie so you are stuck holding an open end of a dirty diaper bag. I don\\\\'t need that. And at any change or refill, you have to find another bag to drop the sausage string of dirty diapers into. With the champ, I open the lid, tie off the drawstring bag and that bag goes straight into the garbage can. The new bag goes in as simple as a trash-can liner and close the lid.2. The genie broke after about 15 months. There are 4 little plastic prongs inside that hold the diaper in place while you twist the ring to seal the diaper in the bag. The spring on one broke and it never held the diapers well again after that.1. And my top reason why the diaper champ is champ: It\\\\'s perfectly easy to use, impossible to use wrong. Whenever we had a babysitter or family member helping while we used the genie, we always took a couple of minutes to show them how to use it. We\\\\'d come home and every time, they\\\\'d gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in. No, it\\\\'s not difficult to use or get right once you do it a few times but if you only use it once a month, that dial on top that turns the cutter is just to obvious to turn to ignore and impossible not to turn. Every single time someone got it wrong. So, the Diaper Champ. you drop the diaper in the open hole and flip the handle and it\\\\'s gone. I can\\\\'t think of a way anyone could do it wrong and most people who\\\\'ve used it so far, don\\\\'t need even the simplest hint from us on how to use it.\",\n",
       "       \"I love this diaper pail. It keeps the diapers from stinking up your room/house. I also love that I can use regualer old kitchen bags and dont\\\\' have to fork over extra bucks for special bags. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that I wish that it held more diapers.\",\n",
       "       \"I chose this product because unlike the Diaper Genie you don\\\\'t have to buy replacement bags, just pop in a tall kitchen garbage bag which we all have in our homes anyway.

There\\\\'s no twisting and no special liners to buy.  As far as smell goes, ALL diaper pails will smell if they\\\\'re not changed often enough.  We don\\\\'t have a problem with ours smelling as long as we change it every three to four days (which should be done no matter what product you buy).  When I got pregnant with my second child (they are only 18months apart) we bought a second Diaper Champ.  We also just purchased one for my brother-in-law and his wife for their new baby.

My complaint, though, is that the plunger-cylinder thing gets stuck because the diapers begin to stack on top of one-another even when the bag is newly-changed.  Also, I do not use the plunger for messy diapers because if the tabs are nor fastened, the tabs get stuck in the plunger thing.

Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing. Hint: If using spray cleaning, don\\\\'t spray water into the drop-in hole.

If you look at the picture you might understand.  After you flip the handle, the diaper on the inside goes into the bag when the cylinder you place it in is vertical, or completely upside down.  On the sides, there are walls that are snug to the round part that flips around. It is between the round diaper flipper thing and the walls that stuff could potentially get caught.

This is a more efficient way to go both because you can buy these bags anywhere and they are less expensive compared to the specialty bags for the Genie.  The unique hopper design allows one-handed use and keeps smells from permeating the nursery.  Overall, we are very pleased with our purchase and recommend it highly.',\n",

I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.  We have to change the bag every couple of days, when it is not even full because it is pretty disgusting.So just because of that I would not recommend it.\",\n",
       "       'Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.  In just a few months use, the Diaper Champ pays for itself by saving money on costly refills needed for other brands.  I have never had an odor problem, but I have a 5-month-old breastfed baby, so I know her diapers now are not as stinky as they will get once we go to solids.  I also use the Glad \"Odor-Control\" bags (the price of 100 bags is probably about the same as a DG RF and will last over a year).  The Diaper Champ is also very easy to use and easy to change bags.  I highly recommend it.',\n",
       "       'I have never written a review for Amazon but I saw some of the poor reviews on the Diaper Champ and had to add my two cents . . .When my sister got pregnant she could not decide if she should register for the Diaper Champ or the Diaper Genie.  She left it up to me and after reviewing both items I went with the Diaper Champ . . .  The idea of having to continually purchase bags for the Diaper Genie seemed like a waste when the Diaper Champ lets you use any type of bag . . .  My nephew is now over two years old and while he has begun potty training, my sister still uses the Diaper Champ I gave her . . .When it came time for me to choose a diaper disposal system, I put the Diaper Champ on my registry.  Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?  True, the mechanism sometimes won\\\\\\'t \"swing\" the dirty diaper into the pail but HELLO that is a sign that it is probably time to put in a new bag.  Yes, it can eventually start to smell if you don\\\\\\'t change it regularly . . . but then again if you used a metal safe lined with carbon to hold your kids diapers eventually baby poop and pee smell would emanate from it if you didn\\\\\\'t clean it out regularly . . . Realistically the thing holds dirty stinky diapers and yep it is going to smell when you open it but hey . . . my kids tush smells when I wipe it but I still love him :)My personal tip . . . if you belong to a wholesale club like BJ\\\\\\'s, Costco or Sam\\\\\\'s check to see if they have the Glad Kitchen Bags.  The BJ\\\\\\'s we shop in has a box of 200 for $9.99.  As long as you do not attempt to overstuff them (i.e., get lazy and don\\\\\\'t change the bag regularly) they work perfectly.  I also use them in the small garbage pails in our apartment.  I could wait for a sale and use a coupon (the way I shop for most things) but it takes months to go through the box and I like knowing they are always on hand . . . At about $.05 a bag, the super duper box of bags makes my life easy and that as any parent knows is ***PRICELESS***.',\n",

A diaper got jammed in it once when the sticky tab stuck to the foam seal in the plunger.  The only way I was able to dislodge it was to tear out the seal.  The pail still works fine, but now the plunger is loose so it bangs around when you turn the handle, which makes more noise than before.4.

The Genie has 2 big advantages over the Champ, in regards to smell control.  1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie\\\\'s twisting mechanism.  2)  The filler bags progress in thickness, so as your child gets older, and her poops get smellier, you can get thicker, better bags.After using the Genie for about a month now, we are very pleased.  The Champ is essentially a simple waste pail with a fancy hood.  The hood and ordinary trash bags don\\\\'t do much for odor prevention.  The drawbacks to the Genie though, are that you must buy their fillers, and the bag changing mechanism is much more complicated than the Champ\\\\'s.  We thought these were worth dealing with to prevent the odors.\",\n",
       "       \"We registered for the diaper champ after comparing it with the diaper genie and diaper dekor at the store.  We had used the diaper genie while working in the church nursery and found it to be extremely difficult to use with the number of diapers we were changing there.  Now our own baby is four months old, and we have loved having the diaper champ at home.  It is so easy to use and does not stink, or at least it hasn\\\\'t yet.  We use Ruffies scented garbage bags and change the bag when full, about every five days.  I would definitely recommend the diaper champ.\",\n",
       "       \"I love this diaper pail!  It\\\\'s so easy to use and I haven\\\\'t had any problems with diaper odors.  I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.  Save yourself some money and hassle and buy the Diaper Champ!\",\n",

       "       \"The champ is great because you don\\\\'t have to waste anymore money buying expensive refills like the diaper genie.  This one uses regular bags (I use 32 gallon bags).  I did have some problems with the odor, but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that\\\\'s inevitable!  Here\\\\'s some tricks for this Champ:1.  Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.  And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don\\\\'t expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.  The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together, otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.  If you\\\\'re like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.  Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.  Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.Hope this helps!\",\n",

It is difficult to open, not to mention everytime I did change the bag my nails would break (and I don\\\\'t have long ones).  My daughter is 19 months, still breast feeding and eating solids and let me tell you, her pooh stinks.  Once I decided to take the Diaper Champ out of the room and walk each diaper to the outside dumpster, it still took weeks for the smell to get out of the room.  It penetrated into the room.  Not to mention, one day, little tiny flies started growing inside.  I was changing the bag on an every day basis.  This is by far the worst product out there.  Take my word for it when I say, I rather take the walk and dump the diaper outside than have to use the Diaper Champ ever again.\",\n",

I found this Diaper Champ - no refills - a definite plus - you just use your regular kitchen garbage bags. Convenient, and less costly!But the big question is - did it work? Did it keep the stink out of my baby\\\\\\'s room?? I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES! It works!Now, if you hover right above the opening and inhale deeply, you will catch a whiff of poo. But who does that?? Sceptical friends who had owned the Diaper Genie (the ones who swore nothing would work!) were thrilled and a little jealous that this thing works so well!I\\\\\\'ve never had an issue with \"skid marks\" as another reviewer posted - 11 months, skid free so far. I have had a seal loosen, as another reviewer mentioned, but as he said - it has not affected the odor prevention of this.Word of warning - it works so well that you will not be prepared for the odor you will get when you open this to change the bag.

I was completely satisfied with my purchase and even bought a second one for our upstairs bedroom.*It really is cost effective.  You don\\\\\\'t have to spend money on refill bags.  I just use the pastic ones from the grocery store.  They work perfectly.*It is so easy to use, so easy to change.  I tried another brand of diaper pail and you had to push a button and flip a lid and push the diaper through...no.  You should spend zero time disposing of diapers and all your time with your new baby.  The Diaper Champ is effortless.*It effectively keeps the room from smelling like dirty diapers.  I live where it is hot and humid and don\\\\\\'t have central air so smell containment is important.  It\\\\\\'s not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.  Scented bags makes the whole room smell kind of nice if you have a super-sensitive nose.*At first I was turned off by the look of the diaper pail, but I have come to appreciate its design.  I bought and tried out a different one and found that the Diaper Champ is taller (about 27\" high) and narrower.  This means that it takes up less floor space but still holds quite a few diapers (I empty it every 2-3 days).  Also I don\\\\\\'t have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.*A small but considerate detail--there is a foot around the bottom of the pail that you can hold down while you change the bag.  This along with the way the weight is centered in the design makes it so the whole thing doesn\\\\\\'t fall over when you open it to change the bag.  The other brand I had tried kept falling over when I tried to change the bag and it was incredibly frustrating.*The only thing against the product I would mention is the noise.  It makes a \"thunk\" when you dispose a diaper into the pail.  I don\\\\\\'t mind it during the day--it\\\\\\'s actually kind of fun to use.  But during night-time changings you have to flip the handle a little slower so it doesn\\\\\\'t make a noise.Anyways, I hope this helps.',\n",

Also, I always make sure that I roll up each diaper securely before putting it in the diaper champ.  We only have to empty ours about every 2 weeks right now (our baby is 11 weeks old) because I change her downstairs half of the time.I really like the fact that you can use your own trash bags.

Think of someone who comes to watch your baby - the diaper champ is so easy and they\\\\'ll almost never have to change the bag for you.  That diaper genie was always full when I was babysitting.  Ugh!The only reason I gave this four instead of five stars, was because you can easily break your nails trying to open it up to replace the bag (the first time I did, despite the warnings!).  And the lid doesn\\\\'t stay open for you to air it out unless you prop it open... but that\\\\'s only for a few mintues anyways.

As an exclusively breast fed baby, there were no odors escaping at all.  (Formula fed babies have stinkier diapers, so I don\\\\'t personally know if it would be as efficient for them.)  My older two actually enjoyed putting the diaper in.  It\\\\'s easy to change out.  I always opened it up outside (if you try to open it inside there will be some odors escape), pulled out the full bag, sprayed the can with lysol, and kept a dryer sheet in the bottom which I changed every month or so.Now that little one is having solids, I personally don\\\\'t expect any diaper pail to contain the smell, so I put dirty ones directly outside.  We still use it for the wet ones.  It has worked out fine because at this point he only has one messy diaper a day.I had a little trouble with the adhesive on the gasket thingee coming loose, but I emailed them and they very promptly sent me a new one for free, along with a few extras in case it happened again (which it hasn\\\\'t), so I think the customer service is good.The only thing I don\\\\'t like about it is that you have to empty it fairly often, but I also recognize that honestly that\\\\'s ridiculous on my part.  The more it holds, the more room it takes up, the heavier it gets, etc.  And the fact that you can\\\\'t go more than two or three days (as a newborn, anyway) is probably one of the reasons it contains the smell.

Woo-hoo!)  Also, you can use regular kitchen trash bags inside it, so you don\\\\\\'t have to buy special bags at an inflated price.  Further, due to it\\\\\\'s extra large containment area you don\\\\\\'t have to take out the trash as often as you would have to with the smaller Diaper Genie and the smell seems to stay inside just fine. :)The one minus that I experienced: According to the directions that came in the box, you can take apart the drum/piston assembly if you should wish to thoroughly clean the inside of it.  When we first bought the Diaper Genie I tried to take it apart.  I *could not* get it to come apart, nor could my husband.  It would not BUDGE-so much so that if the directions didn\\\\\\'t specifically mention that it could be separated I would have assumed that it was not built to come apart.

I have not smelled any bad odor coming from the pail in my son\\\\'s room. It is easy to change a new bag, but I would suggest doing it outside. Once you open it up the smell does escape quickly. But, just give a quick wipe with a disenfectant cloth and put in your own garbage bag and you are ready to put it back in the room. I am very happy to have this diaper pail. I recommend it.\",\n",
       "       \"We love our diaper champ, and are so glad that a friend tipped us off to it. We had the diaper genie on our registry, but someone suggested that we get this instead--because we would save on bags. You can put any small size garbage bag in it- our local Target sells a pack of 90 for 1.99. Plus, from my babysitting days, I remember DiaperGenie being a little hard to use/empty. The diaper champ is easy, just throw the diaper in and flip! If you are trying to choose between the two, I\\\\'d go for the Champ.\",\n",
       "       \"THis thing works!  There were 3 baby cousins born 2 weeks apart in our family, I have the Diaper Champ and the other 2 have Diaper Genies -- I am the only one using my diaper pail. They quit using theirs in a few weeks because of the smells.  They both feed formula and only have one poopy diaper a day, so they immediately remove it from the house. My baby is breastfed and has poopy diapers at most diaper changes and this Diaper Champ diaper pail has been up to the task so far, he is 8 weeks old.  Outside is easy to wipe down with clorox disinfectant, since sometimes the cylinder gets a little runny stuff on it if I don\\\\'t wrap them up tight enough. When it  doesn\\\\'t want to turn and drop all the way down, then that\\\\'s when I know it needs changed. It\\\\'s nice not to have to buy special bags too!\",\n",

       "       'I love this diaper Champ. I got it as a shower gift and hadent heard of it before but when I started using it I had to tell all my friends. This will definatly be my gift of choice from now on to all my pregnant friends. As other reviews say the smell isnt that great when it gets full but its not that bad (I see it as a hint the bag is full and its time to change). I also spray the inside w/ febreeze or lysol disinfectant during each change and that nips the problem in the bud. Overall, Its one of those things that I cant live without but didnt know it until I got it.',\n",
       "       'This was my 3rd diaper pail with my 3rd baby.  This one was by far the best one and the easiest to use. You can use your own bags, which makes it a plus over the Diaper Genie.',\n",
       "       \"I originally bought the Diaper Genie when my son was born. It broke when he turned 9 months so I bought another Diaper Genie. However, the Diaper Genie became very smelly as my son got older and onto solids. I decided to switch to the Champ and I think it\\\\'s much better at handling odors. It also holds a lot of diapers. Not having to purchase special bags is a plus. Now, I agree with others that there is probably nothing out there that truly gets rid of odors, but I think the Champ does a good job. Just make sure the tape of the diaper is not exposed when you throw your diaper in the Champ and try and empty it as often as possible. My son is now 12 months and after 2 Diaper Genies and a Champ, I highly recommend the Champ.\",\n",
       "       \"I had a cheap safety 1st pail and hated it. It fell apart and did not keep down on the stench AT ALL. I read a ton of reviews and thought...&quot;hmm  the diaper dekor sounds the best&quot;. However, I really did not want to deal with buying special bags and all that (plus the pail itself was more expensive). I know I didn\\\\'t want the genie, so I tried the Champ. Since I have not tried the Dekor, I can not really say which is better. But the Champ is easy to use, inexpensive, and keeps down on the bad odors. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS (especially for people who are not rich and dont want to spend the time and effort finding and buying special bags)\",\n",
       "       'my son is now 3 months old and when he was born i didnt have a diaper pail.  well after reading the reviews i decided to go with the diaper champ. let me tell you, the only time it smells is when its full or you open it to change the bag, after that with a fresh bag, there are no disgusting smells. i love this pail and i dont have to worry about forgetting about needing refils and running out at 3 a.m. because i can use my tall kitchen bags! my 3 year old enjoys helping me change the baby because he likes to flip the handle.  this was my best investment for the baby!',\n",
       "       'It stinks - we lysol ours 2-3 times a week. Diapers get jammed and it hardly holds any. We are better off buying a flip garbage can lid for like $6 bucks. Same idea without the headache and the \"diaper pail\" look.The only good thing with this one is you can use any garbage bag you want.',\n",
       "       \"I recieved this pail as a gift and loved the idea that it didn\\\\'t require specifc refills packages. You can use any plastic garbage bag! It\\\\'s easy to use and convienient. One minor detail is you don\\\\'t know when it\\\\'s full until you can\\\\'t turn the handle any  more, but that\\\\'s a small price to pay for this wonderful product.\",\n",
       "       'I am glad I bought this! It uses regular garbage bags and there is no odor at all. It is so easy to use. Thumbs up on this one. I am glad I didnt get the diaper genie..it wouldve been a waste of money!I recommend this diaper champ to everyone!',\n",
       "       \"Its a good product because its easy to use, and you don\\\\'t need the expensive refillable bags like the Diaper Genie.  However, it doesn\\\\'t do so good of a job hiding the smell.  We\\\\'d spray the inside with Lysol disenfectant, but if we waited for the bag to fill up to capacity our room would be full of the dirty diaper smell.  So that\\\\'s the only reason I give it a 4 stars.Its easy to use, and inexpensive when it comes to the refills.  Just doesn\\\\'t mask the smell of dirty diapers that well.\",\n",
       "       'this works really well.  I found it easier than diaper gienie and you can drop in the diaper and dispose with one hand.  To keep odor down you need to change before it gets too full, couple times a week  or more often if have a couple poopy diapersYou also can use any bags.  I have one on each floor of my home.Also keeps the dogs from getting the diapers.  occasionally a diaper will get stuck but that is usually when it is getting too full.  Only prob I have found is when I push on the lever to open to change the bag it is kind of difficult to unlatch and have broken a nail on it a few times- no biggie, kind of annoying.',\n",
       "       'This truly is the champ of diapers. This product, unlike the genie and others, is standalone of \"refills\" (well, you do need garbage bags, but you should already have those). It also does a very good job of keeping the stink away. Not once has the smell came out in such a way that we notice.It also kind of reminds me of the ghost jail thing in Ghostbusters, you know, where they put the trap in and release the ghosts?It\\\\\\'s a great product. It\\\\\\'s kind of big, it\\\\\\'s well made, and it will not need to be changed out for about a week. I\\\\\\'d advise anyone to buy it.',\n",
       "       \"I\\\\'ve read all of the reviews of those of you who can\\\\'t understand why the rest of us hated our Diaper Champs, and I just have to say-give it a while, you\\\\'ll find out. We bought our Diaper Champ when our first son was born. For pretty much  the first year we LOVED it. Everyone is right, you don\\\\'t have to spend money on seperate bags, it\\\\'s a nice height so you don\\\\'t have to bend over it and it\\\\'s really easy to use. I think it takes about a year though, or maybe even a little longer, and it will start to reek so bad that you\\\\'ll want to sleep at the neighbors house just to escape the smell. For all of you who haven\\\\'t used yours long enough-just wait, it will happen. We scrubbed ours with bleach, we emptied it daily, we aired it out in the backyard for two days, and then we finally started putting every single diaper in ziplock bags before putting them in the diaper champ (so much for no extra bags!). NOTHING helped. I\\\\'m not stupid, I understand that when it comes to diapers, nothing is smell proof. We emptied it all the time and disinfected it constantly. But I\\\\'m not talking normal stinky diaper smell. I\\\\'m talking the combined smell of every stinky diaper in the entire world. It was SO BAD. Unless you plan on potty training your child when he turns one, and good luck with that, you\\\\'ll probably end up replacing yours before the diaper days are over. In the end we bought a Diaper Genie. We\\\\'ve used it for two years now and have had no problems. It kinda stinks a little when you open it, but the smell stays in there when it\\\\'s closed. I\\\\'ll buy seperate bags any day if I never have to smell that foul Diaper Champ again.\",\n",
       "       'I see that there are complaints of stinkiness regarding this unit, but short of hermetic sealing, you\\\\\\'re gonna be dealing with poo smell. I think a bit of odor is a fair trade-off for the ability to use normal trash bags and not be locked into yet another system of expendables. (See Braun shaver cleaning cartridges, etc.) The unit relies on a fairly tight seal between the bag (where it passes through the dark blue plastic holder) and the \"funnel\" bottom on the underside of the top portion. If the bag installation is somewhat off this would probably lead to a poor to non-existent seal.That said, the design of the unit is pretty clever - the piston and gravity work to deposit the diaper into the bag in one fell swoop as the handle is rotated through a 180-degree arc, without any hazardous poking of fingers in the vicinity of fresh poo.  That the lid latch is not immediately easy to pop open can be seen as a feature - keeping the contents safe from rude dogs who knock over trash for the goodies inside.  All told it seems to work very well.'],\n",

       "\"This is absolutely, by far, the best diaper pail money can buy.  Never do we detect a diaper odor (and my husband has a very sensitive sense of smell and is usually very quick to complain about such things).  For those who say they have a problem with the Diaper Champ getting stuck...the ONLY time this ever happens to us is when the bag is full and needs to be changed.  We love that it uses regular kitchen trash bags, makes it much more economical.  We have not found that we need to worry about frequent emptying or cleaning.  We just leave the Champ to do its job until the mechanism begins to feel like it\\\\'s getting stuck...then we change the bag.  For us this means about once a week.  Not only is the Champ EASY to use, it\\\\'s kind of fun.  Before our daughter was born we really worried about whether the diaper pail we chose would be effective enough for us because my husband is so sensitive to smells.  But she\\\\'s two months old now and we still just can\\\\'t say enough good things about it.UPDATE:  My daughter is now 9 months old and we STILL love our Diaper Champ.  She\\\\'s eating solid foods, diapers are smellier, but the Champ is still doing it\\\\'s job.  We empty once a week and spray with Lysol.  Yes, there is an odor when changing the bag, but we take the bag directly out to the trash, spray Champ with Lysol, insert new bag and close the thing back up.  Everything is just fine after that.  We are so glad we have the Diaper Champ and cannot sing its praises enough.\""
