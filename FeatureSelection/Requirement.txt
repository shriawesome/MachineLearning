NOTE:
1. For opening large ipynb use the link below
	'https://nbviewer.jupyter.org'

2. I would suggest to use a virtual environment like conda/anaconda.
	'https://conda.io'

3. With the conda environment you'll get preinstalled Python3 and some preinstalled data science modules like scikitlearn, Pandas. numpy etc.
